Project: DESIGN AND SIMULATION OF PASSIVE CONTROL SURFACES ON A SUPERSONIC SOUNDING ROCKET 

Supervisor: Professor David Ingram

Based on work by James Barrowman, (1967), "THE PRACTICAL CALCULATION OF THE AERODYNAMIC
CHARACTERISTICS OF SLENDER FINNED VEHICLES"

Contained on this repository are the MATLAB files required to run this analysis, along with the raw data from the simulation carried out over the course of this project which is used to generate graphs of comparisons.
